This is the flight tracker!

SETUP:
Be sure to populate the API information in the credentials.json. 
OpenSky credentials took a bit of time to work, don't be discouraged if it does not immediatly work.
Install Python

(WIN) LOCALLY RUNS THE APPLICATION (CMD in folder):
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python tracker.py
or any of the other .py scripts included

(PI) LOCALLY RUNS THE APPLICATION (Terminal in folder):
source venv/bin/activate
python tracker.py
or any of the other .py scripts included

You can mess with the setting in the config.ini. I believe the LED dimmesions are hard-coded.
